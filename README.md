# Cosmic Simulator

## Description

Cosmic Simulator is an interactive space environment created with Godot Engine. It simulates a vibrant cosmic scene filled with stars, planets, asteroids, comets, and nebulae. The simulation features dynamic movement, and a day-night cycle.

## Features

- Procedurally generated celestial bodies:
  - Stars with twinkling effect
  - Planets with orbits and "breathing" size changes
  - Asteroids with random movements
  - Comets with tails
  - Colorful nebulae
- Dynamic camera that follows mouse movement
- Day-night cycle affecting background color
- Custom shader for visual effects

## Requirements

- Godot Engine 4.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in Godot Engine.

## Usage

1. Run the project in Godot Engine.
2. Use your mouse to navigate the cosmic scene.
3. Observe the various celestial bodies and their movements.

## Customization

You can easily customize the simulation by adjusting the constants at the top of the script:

- `MAX_STARS`: Number of stars in the scene
- `MAX_PLANETS`: Number of planets
- `MAX_ASTEROIDS`: Number of asteroids
- `MAX_COMETS`: Number of comets
- `NEBULA_COUNT`: Number of nebulae
- `SCREEN_SIZE`: Size of the viewport

## Future Enhancements

- Add user interface for controlling time scale and other parameters
- Implement zoom functionality
- Add more variety to celestial body appearances and behaviors
- Create interactive elements like clickable planets or stars
